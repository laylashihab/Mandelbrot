## Project Description
Mandelbrot Fractal Generator 

Explore different types of fractals and how their unique patterns and shapes come alive as you traverse different 
generations.

## Project Inspiration
This project was inspired by Mandelbrot's book, _The Fractal Geometry of Nature_, which explores the strange world of 
fractals. This project served as a way to delve into this world and better understand how they are produced. 
The concept of fractional dimension was of particular interest as contradicts an intuitive understanding of the world.
This project served as a means to explore fractal creation through recursive algorithms while looking at how the Hausdorff 
dimension is calculated.

## Compilation and Installation Instructions
Ensure you have JDK installed (JDK 11 or higher)
- $ git clone https://github.com/laylashihab/Mandelbrot.git
- $ javac Main.java
- $ java Main

## How to Use
After running the program, the user may select one of the fractal types to explore. Selecting the Triangle or Sierpinski options will
navigate to a canvas with a triangular figure. Pressing the "Next Generation" button will bring the user to one deeper 
generation with more parts that are similar to the original. Pressing the "Last Generation" button reverses this. 
Pressing the "Return Home" button return the user back to the original page to select a new fractal type. 
Selecting the Dragon Curve option will display a canvas with two dots. The user can either draw their own initializer
(the shape that will be repeated) or they may use the original initializer commonly used with Dragon Curves. After 
selecting an initializer, the user will be brought to a canvas to navigate the depth of generations of the curve.
